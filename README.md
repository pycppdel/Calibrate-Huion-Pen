Tutorial on how to calibrate a Huion Pen

Finding the right way how to calibarte a huion pen has cost me much time and effort, and so I decided to make this tutorial

so, you're probably here because you plugged in your second tablet on hdmi or displayport or whatever and your computer successfully detected your device, 
but didn't manage to calibrate the pen correctly. This probably happened because two monitors were plugged in, and now the tablet tries to span over the whole area 
of both displays.
